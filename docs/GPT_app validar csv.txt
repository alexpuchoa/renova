this app's aim is to validate the integrity, encoding, structure, columns and data records of selected by the user CSV files. 

it starts by allowing the selection of the csv file to be processed. it instantly checks if the file is actually a csv or tsv formatted file and saves a rectified version of it, with the data separated by ';' and utf-8 encoded. if the file is for some reason unreadable or completely unformatted, display a message and ask the user to click a button to finish or load another file.

In the next step, the app should present to the user the file's header terms. beside each term, the app should indicate if it adheres or not to the DarwinCore metadata terms. if the term is not adhered, the app should show beside the term a droplist with the list of valid DarwinCore terms alphabetically ordered, added with the option "keep the original".

once the user makes their selections and eventual changes to the header's terms, the app should save another copy of the CSV file now with the new header, and advance to the next step. 

in the next step, the values of each line of the file should be verified. for each line of the file, the app should check if there is any value that do not satisfy a set of quality rules. these rules should be read from a table where, for each column, there may be none or multiple rules related to different aspects of the data like, for instance, valid value ranges, date format, if it is blank or not, if a value is required, and so on.

after the verification of all the lines of the CSV file, a list with every rule violated by each line should be displayed. a files with this results should also be generated. 

please analyze the provided preliminary code and make all the necessary corrections. 

for the sake of clarity and organization, please divide this code maybe in two or three modules. consider the three main tasks it accomplishes: 
1) file rectification, 
2) header adjustment, and 
3) data validation & reporting.

let me know if you need more information, like the html files.
