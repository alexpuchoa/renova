1) A list of detailed functional and non-functional requirements extracted from the questionnaire:

Functional Requirements (FR):
1. Establish a common data repository for all data.
2. Standardize data formats across different sources.
3. Facilitate the ingestion of CSV, unstructured spreadsheets, and structured spreadsheets.
4. Ensure easy access to data for government agencies and the public.
5. Implement a system to manage user access and generate technical and managerial reports.
6. Provide visibility of data through the IPT/SiBBr platform.
7. Identify and correct inconsistencies in raw data files.
8. Implement data ingestion processes with proper handling of external data sources.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):
1. Use a multicloud environment with AWS for the web app and GCP for data manipulation and quality checks.
2. Ensure that the data ingestion and storage solution can handle file sizes between 50KB to 3MB and approximately 200 to 300 files per semester.
3. Implement data quality monitoring and correction processes.
4. Ensure data security and compliance with relevant policies.

2) The list of data quality specific requirements questions that need to be answered:

- How will the system identify and correct inconsistencies in raw data files?
- What processes will be implemented to monitor and ensure data quality?
- How will the system handle data from different sources with varying levels of quality?

3) The list of data governance specific requirements questions that need to be answered:

- What access control mechanisms will be implemented to ensure data security?
- How will user access be managed and controlled?
- What policies will be in place to ensure data compliance and governance?

4) The list of data storage specific requirements questions that need to be answered:

- What type of storage solution will be used (SAN, NAS, Cloud Storage)?
- How will the system ensure scalability and high availability?
- What backup and recovery processes will be implemented?
- How will the system handle the storage of both structured and unstructured data?

5) The list of data integration specific requirements questions that need to be answered:

- How will the system integrate with existing CRM and ERP systems?
- What mechanisms will be used to ensure seamless data ingestion from various sources?
- How will the system handle data standardization across different formats?

6) The list of functional requirements or questionnaire responses that could not be addressed by the currently available specialized agents:

- There are no specific functional requirements or questionnaire responses that cannot be addressed by the currently available specialized agents. All requirements and responses have been mapped to the relevant data management disciplines and can be addressed by the respective specialized agents.

This comprehensive analysis and delegation ensure that the project's business needs are translated into actionable requirements and tasks for the specialized agents, leading to the successful implementation of the data management solution.
