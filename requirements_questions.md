The detailed functional and non-functional requirements extracted from the assessment questionnaire, along with the specific questions for each specialized agent and the unaddressed requirements, are as follows:

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Data Standardization: Transform data into a standardized format, develop a process for transforming data into a standardized format.
   - Data Visibility: Use IPT/SiBBr for data visibility and community access.
   - Data Repository: Establish a common repository/database for all data.
   - Data Access Control: Manage and control user access to data, develop a data governance framework and implement access control mechanisms.
   - Data Ingestion: Ingest data from multiple sources in various formats (.csv, .xlsx, .txt), develop a process for ingesting data from multiple sources and ensuring seamless data integration.
   - Data Quality Monitoring: Identify and correct data inconsistencies, establish a system for identifying and correcting data inconsistencies.
   - Data Reports: Generate management and technical reports.
   - User Roles: Internal Administrators to manage user access and data resources, External Data Suppliers to insert data into the solution, External Auditors to verify data quality, External RNP Administrators to provide support and manage IAM.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Cloud Infrastructure: Utilize a multicloud environment (AWS for web app, GCP for data manipulation).
   - Volume of Data: Handle data files ranging from 50KB to 3MB, with 200 to 20,000 records per file.
   - Data Security: Ensure data manipulation and storage in a secure cloud environment.
   - Data Format: Support ingestion of structured and unstructured data formats.

3. **Data Quality Specific Requirements Questions**:
   - How should the system identify and correct data inconsistencies in biotic data collection files?
   - What methods or tools should be used for monitoring and ensuring data quality?
   - How should the system handle incompatible headers in raw data files?
   - What specific rules from the Darwin Core documentation should be implemented for data quality checks?

4. **Data Governance Specific Requirements Questions**:
   - What specific governance framework should be developed to manage and control user access to data?
   - How should the access control mechanisms be implemented to ensure data security and compliance?
   - What roles and responsibilities should be defined for internal administrators, external data suppliers, external auditors, and external RNP administrators?

5. **Data Storage Specific Requirements Questions**:
   - What type of common repository/database should be established for all data?
   - How should the repository handle data files ranging from 50KB to 3MB, with 200 to 20,000 records per file?
   - What storage configurations are necessary to support ingestion of structured and unstructured data formats?

6. **Data Integration Specific Requirements Questions**:
   - How should the system ingest data from multiple sources in various formats (.csv, .xlsx, .txt)?
   - What process should be developed for ensuring seamless data integration from multiple sources?
   - What tools or technologies should be used for data ingestion and transformation?

7. **Unaddressed Requirements**:
   - Data Visibility and Community Access: The requirement to use IPT/SiBBr for data visibility and community access could not be specifically delegated to the available specialized agents.
   - Data Reports: The requirement to generate management and technical reports could not be specifically delegated to the available specialized agents.
